This was a group project given in Machine Learning course. The group consist of 4 people. In the project, we 
have developed a Studentâ€™s Adaptability Level in Online Learning Classifier to predict the level of adaptivity 
(low, medium and high) by a student depending upon his/her personal characterstics, background, access to 
technology, facilities etc.

The dataset we have used is taken form Kaggle and in total it consist of 1205 samples.
